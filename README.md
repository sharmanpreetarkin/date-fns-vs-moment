# date-fns-vs-moment
This project is the comparison of the date-fns vs moment JS.

To start an application --> npm run start To build the application --> npm run build To build an application in production mode --> npm run build --production

We can compare the outputs of the commonly used functions in both the modules and also check the webpack chunk size after build.
